# Hello-World

Nothing special, just a graphical Hello World program I put together in QuickBASIC 4.5. The graphics like the letters and the icon of the CRT monitor with the mouse on the screen are drawn by me. The stars on the background are randomly placed, so they change positions every time you run the program. The letters are drawn to look a little 3D-ish and stand out.

## Tools used

QuickBASIC 4.5 running in FreeDOS 1.3 on VirtualBox 6.1.

Also used GIMP, the GNU Image Manipulator Program; and 7-Zip.

BASIC was the first programming language I learned back when I was a teenager. It is a very old one, and not particularly used much at all in the modern world, but I'll always have a soft spot for it.

In any case, BASIC is a general purpose high-level programming language designed to be easy to learn and use, hence the name BASIC: the Beginners All-perpose Symbolic Instruction Code. QuickBASIC is a dialect of it written by Microsoft back in 1985 primarily for DOS. Version 4.5 which I am using here dates back to 1988. It is similar to GW-BASIC, and unlike other dialects of BASIC, QuickBASIC does not have line numbers that must be typed in for every line of code.

## Build Instructions

You will need QuickBASIC 4.5 and a computer running some compatible version of DOS.
I used FreeDOS, but it does work on some of the newer versions of MS-DOS and PC-DOS. I believe it will work on DR-DOS, but I can't confirm that.
It also works on DOSBox.

If you don't have QuickBASIC 4.5, QuickBASIC 7 should work too, as will QBasic 1.1.

QB64 will run it too, it may want to convert it from QuickBASIC to QB64 first.
A word of advice: You may need to add `_FULLSCREEN` and `_SQUAREPIXELS` to the source code first, otherwise the resolution of the window will look very small.

I don't know if it will run in FreeBASIC.

Open the file "HELLO.BAS" in QuickBASIC (or QBasic or QB64), then run it! In QuickBASIC and QB64, you can compile it to an executable; but QBasic is merely just a slim-down version of QuickBASIC that can only run it.

## License

Because I find this software to be trivial, I disclaim copyright and placed it under the Unlicense. Some jurisdictions do not have a public domain, so the fallback license I picked is the Zero-clause BSD license, since that is about as close to the Public Domain as the Open Source Initiative will allow.

## Useful Websites

These following website helped me a lot. You can get QuickBASIC from here and even learn the language. (It assumes QBasic 1.1 in the tutorial but they will work in QuickBASIC 4.5.)
